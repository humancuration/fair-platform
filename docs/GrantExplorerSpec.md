# Grant Explorer Feature Specification

## Overview
The Grant Explorer is an interactive tool that allows users to browse and filter available grants based on various criteria. It will help users discover relevant grants and provide an engaging way to explore funding opportunities.

## User Interface
- The Grant Explorer will be implemented as a new page in the frontend (e.g. ExploreGrants.tsx).
- It will feature an interactive data visualization (e.g. using D3.js or React Vis) showing grants by category, amount, deadline, etc.
- Users can click on a grant in the visualization to view more details or start the application process.

## Functionality
- Fetch grant data from the backend API to populate the visualization.
- Provide filtering options for grant category, amount range, deadline range, and any other relevant criteria.
- Dynamically update the visualization based on user interactions with the filters.
- Implement hover and click interactions on data points to display additional grant details.
- Integrate with the existing grant application process, allowing users to click through to apply for a specific grant.

## Backend API
- Assumes the existence of a backend API endpoint that returns grant data, e.g. `/api/grants`.
- Grant data should include fields like id, title, category, amount, deadline, description, etc.
- API should support query parameters for filtering by category, amount range, deadline range, etc.

## Technical Considerations
- Use a data visualization library like D3.js or React Vis for creating the interactive grant visualization.
- Ensure responsive design so the explorer works well on different screen sizes.
- Optimize performance by lazy-loading grant details and minimizing unnecessary API calls.
- Implement error handling and loading states for a smooth user experience.

## Future Enhancements
- Allow users to save favorite grants for quick access later.
- Implement keyword search to find grants by name or description.
- Add sorting options, e.g. by deadline, amount, popularity, etc.
- Integrate with user profiles to personalize grant recommendations based on user interests.

This specification provides a high-level overview of the Grant Explorer feature. It outlines the key components, functionality, and technical considerations to guide implementation. The actual implementation may vary based on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.
