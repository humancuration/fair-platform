## 🛠️ Tech Stack (for the Nerds Among Us)

We're not messing around when it comes to tech. Check this out:

- Frontend: React + TypeScript (because we like our code typed and our errors caught early)
- Backend: Node.js + Express (fast, flexible, and fun!)
- AI Models: Python + TensorFlow (making machines learn, one tensor at a time)
- Database: PostgreSQL (for when you need your data relational and reliable)
- DevOps: Docker + GitHub Actions (shipping code faster than you can say "deploy")
