# Fair Platform

A directory and marketplace platform focused on equitable referrals and revenue sharing for startups, SaaS companies, small businesses, and content creators.

## Resources and Assistance

Assistance in organizing and structuring the project setup was provided by ChatGPTs 4o, 4o mini, o1 mini, o1 preview, Claude sonnet 3.5, opus 3, Gemini 1.5 pro, turbo, and Codestral 22b. As in, they did 100% of the coding. All I did was copy paste stuff after asking them for help.

Acknowledgments
Massive thanks to all the AI assistants who contributed to the initial codebase, without whom there would be literally 0 code. This is a no-code project, but that's a misnomer because our AI friends hand-coded everything.
Gratitude to the open-source community for the tools and libraries used in this project. Oss needs to be funded and supported!!!
