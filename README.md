# Fair Platform

A directory and marketplace platform focused on equitable referrals and revenue sharing for startups, SaaS companies, small businesses, and content creators.
## Resources and Assistance

 Assistance in organizing and structuring the project setup was provided by ChatGPTs 4o, o1 mini, o1 preview, Claude sonnet and opus.
 As in, they did 100% of the coding. All I did was copy paste stuff after asking them for help.
